# Stock Trend Forecasting with R

## Description
 Final project for CS512 Machine Learning in Medicine and Health. Consists of one r file split into five differnet sections.

## Tests for stationarity
  - Augmented Dickey-Fuller(ADF)
  
## Models Implemented
  - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (auto.arima was used, so no custom oreders)
  - Regressive K-Nearest Neighbor with custom scalalbe lag periods and k values based on forecast length
  - Feed Forward Neural Network
  
## How to Use
 Clone the repository to your local machine.
 Load/Install all the librares listed at the beginning.
 Find the Model you're interested in (All split with comments)
 Set the forecating period at the beginning of that section.
 Set the stock you wish to analyze and forecast at the beginning of the section.
